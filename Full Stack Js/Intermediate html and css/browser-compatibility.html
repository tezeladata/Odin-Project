    <!-- The history of modern browsing began back in December of 1990 with the release of WorldWideWeb browser. It was written by Tim Berners-Lee while working for the European nuclear research agency known as CERN. It was later renamed to Nexus, to avoid confusion with the World Wide Web. -->

    <!-- Today, it is impossible to imagine the Web without the use of browsers. We have witnessed a shift from standalone applications to HTML5 and Progressive Web Apps that allow applications to fully function within a browser. For example, Microsoft Word and Excel for the longest time could only be executed via a standalone application. Now, you can utilize those applications through any browser without the need to install any files. -->

    <!-- For your web development projects to have a broader reach, you must make sure that youâ€™re testing your web applications against browsers which are most likely to be used by users. Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and other Chromium-based browsers (Microsoft Edge, Brave, etc.) are more common among regular users.  -->

    <!-- W3C World Wide Web Consortium is the authority behind developing web standards to maximize accessibility and consistency of the web experience. W3C is also the authority to develop new features in CSS. This is a closely collaborative approach with the Web as a community as well as companies developing web browsers. -->

    <!-- Traditionally, the Web was desktop computer first. The application was successful if it worked well on desktop browsers. But as smartphones have become more popular, each year more and more users are using mobile devices as their main Web-facing device. In some areas of the world, mobile users are a vast majority. -->

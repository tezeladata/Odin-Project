<!-- SVGs are a very common image format on the web -->

<!-- SVGs are a scalable image format, which means they will easily scale to any size and retain their quality without increasing their filesize -->

<!-- SVGs are often used for icons, patterned backgrounds, graphs / charts, large - simple images -->

<!-- When using regular image formats, we are limited to pixelsize and images are often not responsive -->

<!-- Knowledge check: -->
<!-- xmlns - stands for “XML NameSpace”. This specifies what dialect of XML you’re using -->
<!-- We wouldn't like to use svg when images have complex details -->
<!-- When inlining svg, we can edit many details of our image. But there are also drawbacks, for example code becomes difficult to read -->

<!-- There are many different units that you can use to define sizes in CSS -->

<!-- Absolute units are those that are always the same in any context -->

<!-- One example of absolute unit is px, because it is not related to cm or inch -->

<!-- Relative units are units that can change based on their context -->

<!-- 1em is the font-size of an element (or the element’s parent if you’re using it to set font-size) -->

<!-- 1rem is the font-size of the root element (either :root or html). The math works the same with rem as it did with em, but without the added complexity of keeping track of the parent’s font size.  -->

<!-- A viewport represents a polygonal (normally rectangular) area in computer graphics that is currently being viewed. -->

<!-- Viewport units are vh and vw, they are related to viewport -->

<!-- 1vh is equal to 1% of the viewport height and 1vw is equal to 1% of the viewport width.  -->

<!-- Knowledge check: -->
<!-- em and rem units are relative to other elements, so styling sometimes becomes easier -->
<!-- vh and vw are units related to viewport. They help us for content like hero or images -->
<!-- When using px for margins and paddings, original view is reserved, but it is not like when using relative units -->

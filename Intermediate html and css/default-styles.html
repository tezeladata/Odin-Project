<!-- As we have worked on many projects, we have already encountered with default styles. -->

<!-- A CSS reset would apply new style to that element, so that all browsers are consistent about what they apply. -->

<!-- If you would like to style everything by you and have blank canvas, it is good practice to use css reset. This has downside too, pages are sometimes less accesible -->

<!-- CSS resets of course are not required-->
